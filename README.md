# ImmuCC R script
#       ImmuCC is a tissue deconvolution tool for mouse model that derived from the CIBERSORT method. It was composed of a traing signature matrix specific for mouse and the SVR method called from CIBERSORT.

# 1,    Researchers who are intersted in the application of ImmuCC to estimate the immune composition of mouse tissues, 
#       please cite "Chen,Z.et al.Inference of immune cell composition on the expression profiles of mouse tissue.Sci.Rep.7,40508;doi:10.1038/srep40508(2017)."

# 2,    The core algorithm of ImmuCC is based on a SVR method in CIBERSORT that was developed by Newman et al.

#       subsets from tissue expression profiles. Nature methods 12,453???457,doi:10.1038/nmeth.3337(2015)".
