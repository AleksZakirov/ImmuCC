The scripts in "RNASeq_pipeline.sh" are used to preprocess the RNA-Seq data(from "fastq" to "reads") in four major steps: 
quality control; mapping; bam file sorting; quantification.
After that, the scripts in "HTSeq_stat.R" were used for merging the expression of immune receptor gene families 
and data normalization.
