The scripts in "RNASeq_pipeline.sh" are used to preprocess the RNA-Seq data(from "fastq" to "reads") in four major steps: quality control; mapping; bam file sorting; quantification. After that, the scripts in "HTSeq_stat.R" were used for merging the expression of immune receptor gene families and data normalization.

Notes:
1, For paired end sequencing data, two fastq files should ended with "_R1.fastq" and "_R2.fastq"; for single end sequencing data, the single fastq file should ended with ".fastq". However, you can also modify our scipt directly.

2, you can download the lattest gtf and fastq file to build the reference data because there is duplicate gene symbols in previous versions.
   
3, You should better exambine your data quality from both "old_fastqc" and "new_fastqc" file, because our scripts will run all preprocessing steps at one time. The expression profile of those low quality data (For examble: high duplicating rates, low sequencing length et.al) should be removed as usual RNA-Seq analysis.
